                    Added bits() function to read/write several bits from a number,
                    toBits() and fromBits() now work with 32- and 64-bit lengths,
    				API Change: toBits() and fromBits() now use UInt and Array<Int> instead of Int and Array<Bool>,
    				API Change: writeInt and writeUInt functions changed parameters from foo(b, num, pos) to foo(b, pos, num) to pattern used by other langs/APIs.",
